what the fuck is this shit
what is the use of dms??
what purpose does this exercise serve?
what am I supposed to learn from solving this?
what am I doing with my life?
ok so they want you do write a fx
that takes a float
and turn it into some retarded format of degrees mins and secs
o ok that thing is just the degree symbol
ok how the fuck do I convert the float into minutes and seconds
it says right there 60mins in a degree.. ok what the fuck does that mean
60 mins in 1 degree??
    - that means 1 degree = 60m?? what? the fuck? fuck this bro 
    - yes, that's pretty much exactly what it is bro it's just unit conversion
